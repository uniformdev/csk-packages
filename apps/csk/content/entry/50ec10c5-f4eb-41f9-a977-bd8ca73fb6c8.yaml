                    Grinding coffee is an essential step in the brewing process,
                    and with so many affordable options, it's a step you should
                    consider taking out of the supermarket and into your home.
                    Like many things at the supermarket, coffee is a food item
                    that begins to get stale sooner if you grind it ahead of
                    time. Grinding at home will allow you to enjoy the freshest,
                    tastiest version of your favorite brew. Here's everything
                    you need to know about how to grind for any situation.

                  text: "Grinding makes coffee particles small enough so that when you pour water, it can extract flavor. If you simply throw whole beans into your coffee brewer, you'll end up with slightly coffee-flavored water, because the water can't penetrate the beans and find all the good-tasting stuff we're looking for. Grind size \"ultimately impacts how water flows through the coffee bed, the corresponding extraction rate, and thus the final taste of the coffee you've brewed,\" says Sierra Yeo, the 2022 UK Brewers Cup Champion. Simply put, grinding coffee changes the available surface area for water to interact with coffee. The more surface area, the more water can mingle with, and pull flavor from, beans.\_"

                  text: "One way to think about grind size is to visualize how water would flow through a bunch of rocks versus sand. Sand particles are much smaller and have more surface area, so water would move through much more slowly than through rocks. Ground coffee is the same: The finer the grind, the more slowly water will move, and vice-versa. You might think then that you should grind your coffee as fine as possible, but, like Goldilocks, there's a sweet spot where you want to extract enough — but not too much — from your coffee.\_"

                    Grinding isn't just about the size of your coffee particles
                    but their shape and consistency. "The geometry of your
                    coffee grounds, the average size of your ground particles,
                    even the composition of differently-sized-and-shaped
                    particles can affect the final flavor," says Yeo. Water will
                    move through your coffee at different rates if you have
                    particles in your brew that are all different shapes. Very
                    finely ground particles might get too much of their flavor
                    pulled out (this is where you'll get more bitter notes, what
                    we call "over-extraction"), while coarser ground particles
                    won't get enough of their flavor pulled out ("under
                    extraction"). If you have both going on in your brew, it
                    won't just even out — the coffee will taste both bitter and
                    sour simultaneously.

Burr grinders can be automatic (you press a button, and it grinds) or manual (usually involving a crank one must turn).\_"
