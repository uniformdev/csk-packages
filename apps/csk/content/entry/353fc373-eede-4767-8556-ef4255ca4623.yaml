                    Before and after you run your espresso shot, press the “go”
                    button and purge the water for a second before putting your
                    portafilter in. The main goal here is to get rid of any
                    grinds and gunk stuck on the dispersion screen. Just by
                    running the water for a second before and after your
                    espresso shot will do wonders to keeping your machine clean.

Regardless of what your one looks like they’re all used for the same job, backflushing. Pop in your blind basket and put your portafilter in the machine and run a shot. The water will hit the basket and won't be able to pass through, forcing the water back up into the grouphead. This helps clean out any grinds, oils or gunk trapped up inside of the machine. When you have full pressure, you can “crack” the portafilter out slightly and you will see all of the grinds and gunk spew out the sides. Do this over and over until you have completely clear water coming out.\_\_"

                    The dispersion screen is the little screen that sits at the
                    bottom of the group head. This screen is responsible for the
                    spread and the flow of water going onto your puck and can
                    get absolutely riddled with grinds, oils and other gunk.
                    When you pull an espresso shot, you are extracting the
                    coffee at 9 atmospheres of pressure and when the shot is
                    done it creates a vacuum above it and shoots all of the oils
                    and grinds back at the dispersion screen. Even more reason
                    to clean it!
