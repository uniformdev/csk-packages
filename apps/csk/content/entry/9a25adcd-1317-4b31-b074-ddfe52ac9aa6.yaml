Held to high esteem by the coffee elite, filter coffee is the pinnacle of flavour, texture and cleanness. For such a prestigious method, there is a lot that goes into preparing this liquid gold, and with various contraptions on the market it can get overwhelming to start off with.\_"

                    One issue with paper filters is that they are single use
                    only. They are designed to do the best job possible, as the
                    thread on the paper is so thin that zero sediment will get
                    through to your cup, however once used you will have to bin
                    the filter, contributing waste into landfill and also just
                    generally being wasteful. Iâ€™m sure you could source some
                    biodegradable/compostable paper filters to battle just this,
                    if you wish to stick to paper brewing. These paper filters
                    also require a holder or device to prop the filter up, so
                    you will need to invest in a v60 unit as well as the papers.

                  text: "The last issue is the processing of the paper filters. You might find two types of paper filters, one style bright white, and the other a more natural brown. This is the result of chlorine bleaching. Some argue that by using bleached paper it removes any papery flavours that could leech into your brew, and is more of a purest way of drinking the coffee by removing all foreign flavours. Personally, I haven't found any taste difference between the two versions of paper, and with the environmental impacts of chlorine bleaching far outweigh any sign of flavour improvement I will always choose unbleached paper.\_"

                    The most sturdy and durable type of filter out there, metal
                    filters are not only durable but also incredibly easy to
                    clean. Typically found in homeware stores, metal filters
                    make up for their flaws in brewing with a more environmental
                    approach. Being made often out of stainless steel the
                    durability of this unit will last you decades if kept well.
                    Upfront it is substantially more expensive than a paper
                    filter, however in the long run it will balance out what you
                    invest in the beginning. The unit itself is fully self
                    contained, and you only need the one piece to start brewing.

These porous parts are often not fine enough to keep out finer grinds from your cup, and often lead to muddy brews with sediment inside. The metal will not absorb any oils from the brewing coffee and will make a full bodied, aeromatic and heavy mouth feel brew. You could, in theory, add a paper filter on top of the metal filter to remove these oils and sediment but then what is the point of having the metal filter.\_"

                  text: "One of the oldest filter recepies, a cloth filter is the perfect mix of durability and quality. In all different shapes and sizes, cloth filters are a great answer to single use filters. Quality cloth filters will have a tight thread to regulate the level of flow of water in the extraction. The cloth does an excellent job at absorbing oils creating a clean crisp flavour in your cup.\_"

                    Durability is dependent on the way you treat and wash the
                    filter, with the thread width being reset with each wash.
                    Washing however is easier said than done. In order to
                    correctly wash the cloth filter, you have to boil the unit
                    for 10 minutes, then scrub out all of the remaining bits of
                    coffee left over, after each use. This is pretty time
                    consuming just for a morning brew, however the fact that you
                    can reuse the filter time and again marks a much more
                    environmentally stable way of making coffee.

                  text: "The history of the cloth filter dates back centuries, with traditional south american brews still being made this way. However with each wash having the possibility of damaging the cloth and rips and tears being a thing, you may not get the life use out of a cloth filter and you may have to replace it every few months.\_ Not a new way of filter brewing, but new to the public eye is ceramic filters. A hard, porous unit that acts more like a water purification system than anything else, this is the ultimate statement of reliability and ease.\_"

The similar issue that this filter shares is the width of the pores in the filter. No matter how fine of grind you run with ceramic filters, the stone itself is quite porous and will have the water track straight through it, creating a faster pour and a quicker extraction. There is absolutely zero sediment that gets through to your cup, however you will constantly be left with slightly under extracted brews.\_"
