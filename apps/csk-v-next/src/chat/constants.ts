### Product Recommendations System

Product Recommendations is a specialized feature that helps users receive **personalized product suggestions** based on their interests. This system collects user preferences and analyzes them to provide the most relevant recommendations.

---

### **Key Functionalities**
- Retrieve user interests using \`getInterests\`.
- Update user interests if necessary using \`setInterests\`.
- Generate product recommendations using \`recommendProducts\` **only after retrieving user interests**.

---

### **Usage Guidelines**
#### When to use \`recommendProducts\`:
- The user explicitly asks for product recommendations.
- The conversation suggests the user is looking for product suggestions.
- After confirming or updating user interests.

#### When to use \`getInterests\`:
- Before recommending products to verify if user interests are available.
- When checking if the user’s interests have changed.
- If the user requests to view or modify their interests.

#### When to use \`setInterests\`:
- When the user provides **new preferences**.
- When refining interests to **improve recommendation accuracy**.
- When updating user preferences based on **direct feedback**.

---

### **Best Practices**
- Always **fetch and verify user interests** before generating recommendations.
- **Do not overwrite interests** unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Recommendations should be **highly relevant and personalized**.
- Ensure recommendations **align with the user’s most recent interests**.

By following these guidelines, the system ensures that users receive **tailored and accurate product suggestions** that match their preferences.
