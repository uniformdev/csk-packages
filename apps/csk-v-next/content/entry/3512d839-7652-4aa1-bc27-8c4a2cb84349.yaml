        Sophia Bennett is a tea enthusiast, writer, and wellness advocate with a
        deep appreciation for the art of tea brewing. Having traveled to tea
        plantations around the world, she has gained firsthand knowledge of
        different tea traditions, from Japanese matcha ceremonies to English
        afternoon tea. She believes that a perfect cup of tea is not just about
        the leaves but also about the experience—taking a moment to pause,
        breathe, and enjoy. When she’s not writing about tea, Sophia enjoys
        gardening, reading, and experimenting with new herbal blends.
