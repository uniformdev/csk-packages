                        Today’s announcement is the result of an important
                        refreshment initiative by the Board with a focus on
                        identifying independent director candidates with deep
                        industry and operating experience. With the appointments
                        of Messrs. Clemmer and Koopmans, and the retirement of
                        Mr. Ho, Qorvo’s Board will increase to nine directors,
                        eight of whom are independent. After today’s changes,
                        three of nine directors will have joined the Qorvo Board
                        within the last six months.

                        “We are very pleased to welcome leaders of Rick’s and
                        Chris’ caliber as the newest directors on our Board,”

                        Directors. “Over the course of his successful career,
                        Rick has a proven track record of driving significant
                        growth, reducing operating expenses, rationalizing
                        footprints and executing financial transformations as a
                        public-company CEO and board member. At the same time,
                        Chris brings a forward-thinking mindset that he has
                        honed as a C-suite executive, with extensive experience
                        building and scaling businesses, including expanding
                        market reach and leading corporate transformation
                        initiatives.”

                        their respective and complementary insights will serve

                        margins, generate strong free cash flow and continue to
                        increase value for our shareholders. These director
                        appointments reflect our ongoing commitment to
                        refreshing the Board with new independent directors who
