Unlike ranging, however, UWB radar does not require two devices to communicate, instead capturing signal reflections with a single device (Figure 1). As a result, it is a low cost and low power solution, and when combined with omni-directional antennas, it can detect movement within a 360Â° field of view, enabling full area monitoring with minimal coverage gaps. Additionally, UWB ranging and radar can be combined to enable multifunctional capabilities, such as sensing presence and then securely authenticating."

                    The novelty of UWB radar is that key radar parameters can be
                    configured to tradeoff range, power consumption and coverage
                    area. The more samples that are collected per radar sweep,
                    the longer the detection rangeâfrom a few centimeters to
                    several meters. In addition, if the transmitted radar frame
                    is repeated at a higher rate, it will result in a more
                    accurate location estimate at the expense of higher power
                    consumption.

                    Even with a use case to detect presence up to several
                    meters, UWB radar consumes less than 10mW, making it an
                    optimal low power technology for portable devices, extending
                    battery life and reducing the need for frequent charging.
                    Moreover, UWB radar's ability to monitor vital signs or
                    recognize gestures opens the door to new ways for users to
                    interact with smart devices. By detecting minute movements
                    and specific gestures, it facilitates intuitive and
                    touch-free control interfaces. This is especially
                    advantageous in healthcare and automotive applications,
                    where non-contact interactions enhance safety, security and
                    convenience. Overall, the versatility of UWB radar coupled
                    with its fine-ranging (< 10 cm) accuracy make it a
                    compelling solution that can deliver precise, reliable and
                    energy-efficient performance across a wide range of
                    applications.

                    When evaluating UWB radar alongside other technologies like
                    Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors, several critical differences
                    highlight the strengths of UWB. PIR sensors are commonly
                    used for motion detection, but they only work when the
                    sensor has clear line-of-sight (LOS). They have a limited
                    field of view and are sensitive to environmental factors
                    such as temperature changes, dust and bright light. In
                    contrast, UWB radar operates effectively in LOS and
                    non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, can penetrate walls and
                    maintain accuracy and resolution despite challenging
                    environmental conditions. These attributes make UWB a more
                    versatile solution for many applications.

                    Compared to 60 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, UWB radar
                    offers a different set of advantages. While mmWave radar is
                    effective in specific use cases, such as detecting presence
                    with security cameras or smart thermostats, it typically
                    consumes more power, is more complex to implement and comes
                    with higher solution costs. UWB radar, on the other hand,
                    consumes less power, is simpler to implement and is
                    cost-effective, making it a viable alternative to 60 GHz
                    mmWave radar, especially for short-range radar applications.

                    An important point to remember is that depending on the
                    application, each sensing technology has its own unique
                    advantages. PIR sensors, for example, are excellent for
                    basic motion detection in simple environments, while mmWave
                    radar is valuable where high-precision sensing or
                    high-resolution imaging is needed. UWB radar shines where
                    versatility, precision and multi-functionality are required,
                    such as the combination of sensing and fine ranging.

                    By enabling highly accurate presence detection and motion
                    monitoring, UWB radar redefines the way we interact with
                    smart spaces. Unlike conventional security systems that rely
                    on always-on cameras, UWB radar offers an alternative that
                    prioritizes privacy while maintaining security and
                    functionality. Instead of continuous surveillance, UWB radar
                    can detect human presence and movement, activating in-home
                    cameras only when necessary or eliminating the need for them
                    altogether. This approach mitigates cybersecurity risks,
                    such as unauthorized access to security cameras, while
                    ensuring comprehensive monitoring.

                    Beyond security, UWB radar enhances the adaptability of
                    smart home environments. It can differentiate between humans
                    and inanimate objects to reduce false alarms and enable more
                    responsive automation. Lights, climate controls and other
