                    By utilizing high-frequency radio waves, UWB transmits data
                    over a broad spectrum, which allows it to achieve remarkable
                    precision. This technology measures time of flight with
                    short pulse durations, making it exceptionally accurate. Key
                    components include UWB antennas and sensors, which work
                    together to provide detailed location data, even in
                    challenging environments like multistory buildings and
                    underground facilities.

                    At its heart, Qorvo UWB uses high-frequency radio waves to
                    achieve precise indoor positioning. This technology
                    transmits data across a wide spectrum, which allows it to
                    deliver remarkable accuracy. The magic lies in its ability
                    to measure the time it takes for a signal to travel from a
                    transmitter to a receiver, known as the time of flight.
                    UWB’s short pulse durations enable it to perform these
                    measurements with exceptional accuracy, down to the
                    centimeter.

                    Qorvo UWB employs specialized antennas and sensors that work
                    together to capture and process this data. These components
                    create a detailed map of the environment, pinpointing the
                    exact location of objects and people. Unlike GPS, which
                    struggles indoors, UWB excels in complex environments like
                    multistory buildings and underground areas.

                    Airports and transportation hubs also leverage UWB to guide
                    travelers efficiently, reducing stress and improving the
                    travel experience. From finding the nearest restroom to
                    navigating to your departure gate, UWB ensures you get there
                    smoothly.

                    When evaluating indoor navigation technologies, UWB's
                    precision is a standout feature. Unlike Bluetooth, which
                    provides proximity-based location, UWB offers
                    centimeter-level accuracy, making it the preferred choice
                    for critical applications. For instance, in environments
                    where the exact location of an object matters—such as
                    distinguishing between rooms—UWB excels. Wi-Fi Fine Timing
                    Measurement (FTM) can enhance location data, but it doesn't
                    match UWB's precision. The ability to determine not just the
                    general area but the exact spot within that area is a game
                    changer for industries like healthcare and retail. This
                    level of detail is what sets UWB apart, providing reliable,
                    pinpoint accuracy where other technologies fall short.
