                    , Qorvo's next-generation circuit simulation tool, is
                    meeting that demand while transforming how businesses engage
                    with customers. Just a year after its launch, QSPICE has
                    proven to be more than a design tool—it's a forward-looking
                    innovation that bridges the gap between engineering
                    excellence and business growth.

                    In an industry where speed and accuracy are paramount,
                    QSPICE redefines what circuit simulation tools can achieve.
                    Its unique ability to combine massive digital logic with
                    SPICE simulation marks a revolutionary leap for engineers.
                    “For the first time, you are capable of combining massive
                    amounts of digital logic with your SPICE simulation,”
                    explains Mike Engelhardt, QSPICE’s developer. “This is a big
                    deal—it’s not just faster or free; it’s fundamentally new
                    technology.”

                    QSPICE’s power lies in its ability to handle complex designs
                    with exceptional speed and transparency. For engineers, this
                    means no longer waiting for long simulations or relying on
                    questionable third-party models. “If you’re an experienced
                    modeler, QSPICE speeds things up by a factor of 10,”
                    Engelhardt adds. “And if you’re inexperienced, it makes
                    something that was impossible possible.”

                    With built-in tools like the Model Generator, QSPICE allows
                    users to create robust and transparent semiconductor models
                    directly from datasheets. "This solves a major problem,"
                    Engelhardt explains. "If you're considering using a
                    particular transistor, diode, or MOSFET, you can quickly
                    make a model, run your simulations and decide if it's the
                    right part. And you'll know exactly what was modeled and
                    why."

                    QSPICE's transformative impact isn't limited to engineers;
                    it's also a powerful tool for businesses, particularly in
                    sales and marketing. Qorvo's senior leader, Tim McCune, sees
                    QSPICE as a strategic asset that helps deepen customer
                    relationships and expand brand recognition. "When selling
                    semiconductors, you need a data sheet, application notes and
                    a SPICE model," McCune explains. "QSPICE brings all of this
                    together, helping engineers evaluate our parts quickly and
                    effectively."

                    Engelhardt emphasizes how QSPICE simplifies a traditionally
                    cumbersome process. "The heartache factor is huge," he says.
                    "QSPICE makes creating models less error-prone and
                    incredibly efficient. It turns something frustrating into
                    something seamless."

                    For sales teams, the benefits are clear. In meetings, QSPICE
                    enables sales professionals to demonstrate Qorvo's parts in
                    action through live simulations. This hands-on approach
                    resonates with customers, providing a tangible understanding
                    of how Qorvo's components perform. McCune notes, "You don't
                    have long to make an impression. With QSPICE, we can
                    show—not just tell—what our solutions can do."

                    Additionally, QSPICE's transparency offers customers
                    confidence in their design choices. Engelhardt highlights
                    this advantage: "Most people using third-party models don't
                    know what the modeler thought was important or not. With
                    QSPICE, it's completely transparent. You know exactly what
                    you're working with, and it just works."

                    By offering a free, high-quality simulation tool, QSPICE
                    positions Qorvo as a trusted partner for engineers and
                    decision-makers. This strategy mirrors the success of other
                    industry-leading tools, like Linear Technology's LTspice,
                    and reinforces Qorvo's reputation as a leader in innovation.
                    "We're not afraid to let people compare our parts with
                    competitors," McCune says. "A substantial amount of the
                    time, they'll pick Qorvo."

                    As QSPICE enters its second year, the focus is on building
                    momentum. Awards like the Electra Design Tool of the Year
                    and the Golden Electrons Award validate Qorvo’s investment
                    in QSPICE, but the tool’s real value lies in its ability to
                    drive tangible results. From securing design wins to
                    strengthening customer relationships, QSPICE is positioned
                    to play a key role in Qorvo’s growth strategy.

        As QSPICE enters its second year, the focus is on building momentum.
        Awards like the Electra Design Tool of the Year and the Golden Electrons
        Award validate Qorvo’s investment in QSPICE, but the tool’s real value
        lies in its ability to drive tangible results. From securing design wins
        to strengthening customer relationships, QSPICE is positioned to play a
        key role in Qorvo’s growth strategy.
